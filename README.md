# AutoSweeper
MineSweeper with autosweep algorithm

Menu Options:
"Play": Standard game of minesweeper on a 20x20 board with 100 bombs.
  
  Controls: Left click to open tile. Right click to flag tile

"Auto Solve": Automatically solves the board once initial click is preformed. IMPORTANT, due to mine sweeper being a somewhat random game, a full clear is not usually
possible without some amount of guessing. Therefore, the algorithm will stop once it can not detect any more guaranteed actions.
  
  Controls: Right arrow key to go to next action. Left arrow key to go back.
